Demonstrations of tcpsubnet, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


tcpsubnet summarizes throughput by destination subnet.
It works only for IPv4. Eg:

# tcpsubnet
Tracing... Output every 1 secs. Hit Ctrl-C to end
127.0.0.1/32               8
127.0.0.1/32              10

This example output shows the number of bytes sent to 127.0.0.1/32 (the
loopback interface). For demo purposes, I set netcat listening on port
8080, connected to it and sent the following payloads.

# nc 127.0.0.1 8080
1111111
111111111

The first line sends 7 digits plus the null character (8 bytes)
The second line sends 9 digits plus the null character (10 bytes)

Try it yourself to get a feeling of how tcpsubnet works.

By default, tcpsubnet will categorize traffic in the following subnets:

- 127.0.0.1/32
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

You can change this default behavoir by passing a comma separated list
of subnets. Let's say we would like to know how much traffic we
are sending to github.com. We first find out what IPs github.com resolves
to, Eg:

# dig +short github.com
192.30.253.112
192.30.253.113

With this information, we can come up with a reasonable range of IPs
to monitor, Eg:
 
# tcpsubnet.py 192.30.253.110/27,0.0.0.0/0
Tracing... Output every 1 secs. Hit Ctrl-C to end
0.0.0.0/0               3516
192.30.253.110/27       2501
192.30.253.110/27         37
0.0.0.0/0               2037
192.30.253.110/27       1146
192.30.253.110/27      12698

If we would like to be more accurate, we can use the two IPs returned
by dig, Eg:

# tcpsubnet 192.30.253.113/32,192.130.253.112/32,0.0.0.0/0
Tracing... Output every 1 secs. Hit Ctrl-C to end
0.0.0.0/0               4416
192.30.253.113/32        230
0.0.0.0/0               3138
192.30.253.113/32       1337
0.0.0.0/0               2537
0.0.0.0/0               3206
0.0.0.0/0              12736

NOTE: When used in production, it is expected that you will have full
information about your network topology. In which case you won't need
to approximate subnets nor need to put individual IP addresses like
we just did.

Notice that the order of the subnet matters. Say, we put 0.0.0.0/0 as
the first element of the list and 192.130.253.112/32 as the second, all the
traffic going to 192.130.253.112/32 will have been categorized in
0.0.0.0/0 as 192.130.253.112/32 is contained in 0.0.0.0/0.

The default ouput unit is bytes. You can change it by using the
-f [--format] flag. tcpsubnet uses the same flags as iperf for the unit
format and adds mM. When using kmKM, the output will be rounded to floor.
Eg:

# tcpsubnet -fK 0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0                  5
0.0.0.0/0                 10
0.0.0.0/0                 16

Just like the majority of the bcc tools, tcpsubnet supports -i and --ebpf

It also supports -v [--verbose] which gives useful debugging information
on how the subnets are evaluated and the BPF program is constructed.

Last but not least, it supports -J [--json] to print the output in
JSON format. This is handy if you're calling tcpsubnet from another
program (say a nodejs server) and would like to have a structured stdout.
Eg:

# tcpsubnet -J -fK 192.130.253.110/27,0.0.0.0/0
{}
{"0.0.0.0/0": 3, "192.30.253.110/27": 2}
{"192.30.253.110/27": 0}
{"0.0.0.0/0": 1, "192.30.253.110/27": 1}
{"0.0.0.0/0": 0}
{"192.30.253.110/27": 13}
{}

    ./tcpsubnet 10.80.0.0/24    # Trace TCP sent to 10.80.0.0/24 only
    ./tcpsubnet -J              # Format the output in JSON.
